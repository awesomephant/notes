## Design is always political

From who you work for, what you work on, who you involve in the process, who is affected by the product. Design = Labour = Political

> Design is the intentional solution to a problem within a set of constraints

(increasing shareholder value isn't a problem)

North Carolina's 12th district is gerrymandered
It puts three black democratic cities into one district so they only get to have one congress person

This is all _designed_. The maps are designed in such a way to keep the status quo.

After the voting rights act was repealed in 2016, all these states started making voter ID laws to keep black people from voting. ALl sorts of bad things are the result of this.

[Trump mocking a disabled reporter]

But also the resistance is a result of this.

A system designed to fuck someone is designed that way on purpose, and people need to be accountable.

## A lack of ethics is a precursor to fascism

AIGA tweet: should the poor behaviour of big businesses...

Can you imagine doctors or lawyers debating wether ehics should be important?

Uber CEO Travis something joind Trumps business council. He doesn't get credit for stepping, 

> We'll partner with anyone in the world as long as they're about making transportation in cities better

It's like Mussolini saying he'll make the trains run on time

Susan Fowler: Reflecting on one very, very strange year at Uber

Talks abuot how the HR didn't help her - this is also a result of design. We've spent decades rolling back worker protections, unions etc. 

Design must have an ethical core

Vokswagen engineer who "was just following orders" ended up going to prison

Politico: The great wall of america
A design firm which wanted to make the wall more attractive

"The firm's principal didn't want to talk politics, they were just about architecture"

Fuck form. Measure impact.

You cannot design a good border wall, a good muslim database, a good gun becuase those things are all inherently evil. To design them well is to make them more evil.

Apple refused to write software that would let the government get into iPhones.

Earning your rent at the cost of someone else's livelihodd isn't a good way to live. 

## Don't follow orders

Good trouble. 

WHen your design team is all white men you've already started marginalising people before you've made anything.

The intercept: Palantir provides the engine for donald trumps...
This is the data mining firm of Peter Thiel. This is the software that ICE and people like that use to round up immigrants.

When you put your labour into creating thins you're responsible for what that thing does in the world. The questino of should I design it is more important than can I design it.

There are professions more harmful than industrial design, but only a very few of the,

Design for the real world book

## Listen

Twitter didn't listen when people started being abused, nazis showed up etc. They didn't predict people were going to use the platform for evil.

Silicon Valley doesn't care about poor people, black people, women, immigrants. This is what the service economy is built on. The rise of fascism in america came at a time of massive inequality.

Teams need to reflect the world we live in. Rich white dudes will only ever solve th problems of rich white dudes.

## Questions

### Let's talk about the internet, is it the right tool for change etc.

In the 90s there was all this talk about democratising the world "neticens" were a thing. We fucked that up. If you compare what we have today to what we wanted ni the 90s we;ve achieved close to 0%. Part of the problem is we built things we had no idea how to do. The problem with Twitter started 12 years ago when it was built by a group of white boys. It never occured to these people that you might be harrassd online because that never happened to them. Same thing with Facebook. We didn't think things through because of what we meant by we. 

The second part is the ide athat young people don't know what they're doing. Young people in America are working on a problem that their parents' generation fucked up.

[Twitter and Teargas book]
The book makes the point that twitter facebook allowed movemenets to grow so quickly that they didn't have time to develop roots. The reason the civils rights movement succeeded is because it was slow, basically built on writing letters, required loads of organisation.
