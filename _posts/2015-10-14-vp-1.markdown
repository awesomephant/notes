##how to get commissions
right place right time
put your work out for people to see
use contacts
if people like your work they will pass it along
get your work to a level where you are confident to sell it

phillip pullman his dark materials

##process of commissions
the olive fairy book, the folio society
- you get the total number of illustrations
- you read the book and figure out where your illustrations might go
- you send them a list of page numbers
- Use rough sketches to figure out
- you finish the cover first

##half page illustrations
you dont get as much control over where they will go
you get a list of pages and sizes

#process
- Detailed line work in pencil
- Patterns in watercolour on a seperate sheet (using a lightbox)
- Scan both sheets and finish colouring and textures in Photoshop

Get the character and style of handdrawn illustration and the precision and control o digital tools.
