Industrial revolution brought huge changes, artists responded to that (samuel palmer recreates a vision of England before the industrial age)

londons population doubles in 100 years 1801 to 1911
People had to move to the cities, poverty grew

(the language of walls)

advertising culture begins to take hold of urban space (lots of shit going on in the city, competition)
posters beome a part of urban landscape (painting on the sides of buildings, clapham)

Invention of lithographic printing allows for bigger posters in mass reproduction
before that reproduction of images was limited, follows the mass production of products
