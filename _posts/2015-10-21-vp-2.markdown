Nasty Gal is a fast-growing clothes brand. They work with lots of different designers, freelancers and interns, so they needed some way to introduce consistency.
A full brand styleguide would have been too limiting, so Colophone designed three bespoke typefaces for them.

NG Grot 2
NG Grot 3

no regular, bold or light, less strict than a brand styleguide
alternate characters, alternate punctuation
automatic application of style
