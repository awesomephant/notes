## Stuff that has influenced me

- superheroes, superhero fingerpuppets
- record sleeves (beatles)
- pop art imagery
- comics (archie as purehart the powerful) colours, print, ragged edges of pages, poor print quality
- walt disney

![blake and mortimer](http://images.delcampe.com/img_large/auction/000/061/619/190_001.jpg?v=2)
Belgian comics (Blake et Mortimer). Belgian comics are very much unlike American ones. They are beautifully printed, hard cover books with serious stories and very high quality drawing.

Maurice Tillieux: Gil jourdan

![kirby](https://unboxup.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/jack-kirby-eternals-splash-pages-2.jpg)
Jack Kirby's Marvel comics. Amazing futuristic scenes, machines, ridicolous stories like superman vs frankenstein

- Children's activity books. Reduced shapes, limited colour palette, leaves a lot up to the imagination
- Comic lettering. Huge drop shadows, conveys excitement

![men only](https://www.fulltable.com/vts/m/mag/coversmo/SH686.jpg)
Men Only magazine covers (1940s). Loose linework, flat colour

Never mind the bollocks, here's the sex pistols

## Stuff I look at
- Shop signage
- Lettering
- Ice cream vans
- Neon signage
- Random stickers
- Lettering with snow on top
- Straightforward shop names
