## stuff that has influenced me

- superheroes, superhero fingerpuppets
- record sleeves (beatles)
- pop art imagery
- comics (archie as purehart the powerful) colours, print, ragged edges of pages, poor print quality
- walt disney
- belgian comics (blake et mortimer) hard cover, serious, high quality comics (gil jourdan, la voiture ...)
- jack kirby marvel comics, amazing futuristic scenes, machines, ridicolous stories, superman vs frankenstein
- children's activity book (reduced shapes, just two colours
- comic lettering (drop shadows, conveys excitement )
- men only magazine (loose linework, flat colour)

any advice for finding a good workspace?
we just replied to an ad 
the market is getting more competetive
renting a place is definitely a learning process
find a group of people you like working with and set up a studio with them
people will change
split the rent between a number of people
