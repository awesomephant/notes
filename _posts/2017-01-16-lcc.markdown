## designing for the unreal world
thomas twaites (http://www.thomasthwaites.com/)

Toaster project: http://www.thetoasterproject.org/page2.htm

making a toaster from scratch (iron ore) for rca ma degree show 2009
begins with the fantasy of self-sufficiency, could you make it on a desert island
(comes from a section hitchhikers guide to the galaxy)

disassembled the toaster (what a good image)
counted 400 bits
started simplifying and substituting stuff for simpler materials (5 materials)

how do you make steel
talk to a man at the royal college of mines (seems excessive doesn't wikipedia say how to make steel)
phoned up the nearest iron mine to london can i come down and get some iron ore to make a toaster? can i speak to john please - oh hes underground!
got philosophical in the mines

dragged a suitcase full of iron ore back to london, looked for a recipe to make metal from rock
went back to the 16th century books to understand how to make a furnace with really basic technology

when i callled up the iron mine i didnt know i would give a talk later, show how important it is to document everything, the project relly became about the story 
melted the iron cake the microwave, went through 4
went to wales for a copper mine, got water with copper dissolved in it that i could electrolyte out melt and cast plugs

scotland mica mine

talked to a bp pr guy to get oil to make plastic from. The point of the project was really to email people

you can make plastic from potato starch (failure)
concept of athropocene, we live in a new geological age, whats in the roc thats laid down in that age? theres plastic in it, can i not mine plastic bearing rock in the same way i mined for copper?

went to a plastic resycling company

carved a mold for the plastic case out of wood

project was realyly one failture after another, the project became weaving that failture into a compelling story

the point was to create an object to create debate, critical design, speculative design
sort of the opposite of industrial design
how do we move to a real sustainable worl where we don't go live in a cave

## more rescent projects!

south korea
virtua; reality documentary from the future about the present
looking at grainy films from the past, imagining what it would be like if you lived in the 19th centre
what will people 200 yrs from now thinl about vr films
trying to provoke a new way of looking at the modern day, looking at ourselves with fresh eyes
film is a mixture of mundane facts, voicover gettng things wrong

## design museum
designers shape onkects and places and processes to reflect the vlalues and the identity of those who use them

its not that simple, theres afeedback loop between design and identity, design creates identity creates design

how do tools shape us@ google auto complete
quantified self, tracking yourself with data science

proposing a new startup slash religion based on a babylonian god named nebo, who controlled peoples fate by wrtiting it down
made w wifi router that would start to control what you could do and see on the internet
set top boc that wout let you wtc thingswallet that decides wht you buy

it becomes hared an harder to propse a design fiction as reality moves so wuickly

##  took care of this dog DREAM
its better to be a human disatisfied than a pig satisfied

but that sounds quite cool, take a holiday from being a human
sounds like a childish dream, but wrote quite a serious application to the wellcome trust
got 30 grand for it
in terms of taking a vacation from being a concious human, elephant are a bed target (they live in families and things)
saw a shaman in copenhagen who told him to beocome a goat
becoming an animal wasnt a new idea, shamans have been doing this since early history
oldest piece of figurateive art the lion man
again people becoming animals forever
what's going to be my contribution to this ongoing desire
spoe to a goat psychologists
mai difference between us and most animals is aility to imagine past and present
transcranial magnetic stimultaion, interrupt electric activity in your brain so you can switch parts off
got this guy to turn off his speec ability

next thing was how do I make my body into that of a goat

royal vetenary college dude who worked on big dog walking robot
humans and all sorts of creatures share anatomy bc we evolved from the same ancestor
weird to see animals go from recongnizable animal to recognixable cut of meat

## GUTS
goats can live off grass bc they have an extra stomach. made a prosthetic extra stomach, silicone bag that had goat bacteria in it, chew grass, have bacteria digest it, then eat what coems out of that

this early robot arm dude
goat man, how i toook aholiday from being human

qs
toaster goat, v different outcomes similar processes
one of theose things you only realise after
simple yet turns out impossible goal

crossing disciplines
going thoruugh failures
telling a story at the same time
they are in away the same structure, same design journey, maybe it is a question

team? who was taking the photos
weirf thing that doesnt come out in the media. even though it seems ridiculous, there is a serious undercurrent in the work. looking at the world in the different way, science communication
media make it aobut the crazy person who wants to live as a goat
when youre working on something it doesnt seems that crazy 
have random firends who take photos and videos

youre v keen on experts
partly as an excuse to go in strane bits of unis where weird stuff is going on, getting access to people anf giving themm a bizarre question. It's about fantasy meeting reality, fighting cerayin bits of aestheti t-in the design world


competition - complementarity
disempowerment - solidarity
inequality - equality
isolation - togetherness
common ownership

qs
theres the criticism that coops are a sort of small scale thing, dont really have the optimisim to change the larger system.

Coops are a small short term step in the right direction
