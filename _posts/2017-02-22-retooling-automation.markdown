Important to have a conversation about automation - tons of jobs will be replaced by machine learning etc. 

Myths:
1. AUtomayion is a good thing. It will and already has disrupted many aspects of our lives. Often has negative outcomes on a lot of people
2. Automation is bad. The potential from automated production is immense. If benefits can be distributed things will be great
3. auomation is purely an economic thing. Washing machine is a better progressive technology than your phone. No ones ever been relieved when their wm broke, wheres we are with phones.
4. Automation cannot affect artists and designers, eg its irrelevant to our practice. What kind of economci support will there be for the art when service jobs will be taken away - how will artists fiance shit. What new recource will be available from us from automation, distribution, vr, production, 3d printing, materials. It's up to us to afect what vocab and imagery we use to talk about new technology. We use science fiction to talk about automation, which comes from people like us. What narratives do we use to talk about automation

people talk about their relationship with the machines
people feel like they're slaves to the machine - "it keeps you alive but it also keeps you prisoner"
Are you a cyborg? These folks can't live without the machines.
Made a response where sheep is a dialysis machine. Retired greyhound becomes mechanical ventilator. Tension between a organic technological device

FOund a room for discarded machines. The Immortal. All sorts of life support machines are connected to each other, there just isn't a patient. Minerals are added and removed. They're keeping each other alive forever, pumping around a blood replacement forever. THe installation takes up a room whereas the same system in our body only takes up a smaller space
fritc kahn, human body seen as industry palace. Body seen as a factory of blood and oxygen. Installation reflects how western medicine sees our body'same

Designed an object that has no function except to create a coreogtapy of chinese workers assembling it in a factory. All the dimensions and stuff exists to create a specific movement. Got access to the factory and filmed the assembly. Made 45 objects + a film

tension between machines trying to act like bodys, bodys asked to behave like machines
Made in china, communism vs capitalism etc

Art can't exists outside of real world production, we have to reconstruct stuff from the inside

work around goldfish and the body of the animal. relationship with goldfish, nature. Fish that don't exist in nature. The more unnatural the fish are the more succesful they tend to be in competitions. Super long history back to edo period. -> bonsai breeding
Symbolised nature
production of fish as a technical, economic, social, cultural process. Worked with a scientist to make a batch of goldfish fo them that can't reproduce, that doesn't have any reproductive organs. Living organism as an object, living art object. Lifestyle pets. com show up sterile so you can't make more of the and ruin the business model

made a machine that can make a goldfish that can't reporduce. Injects fish embryos etc
What happens when the fish die etc

Hacking the future of money (book)

Things that are on the market have utility and some human production process attached to them
human labour component is being eroded
outputs of one production cycle can be inputs for a new cycle

capitalist production

- private property systems
- money systems
- markets

You enter markets to get inputs (eg raw materials, labour) to create outputs
people who make the stuff don't own the machines (eg means of productions)

automation is about making machines to replace manual labour, that's why there is so much investment

people think service economy is divorced from raw recources, but it relies on phones eg copper and whatnot
Tools take human force and amplify it
Now a machine is an assembly of interconnected parts, and it has a non-human energy source. They have an interface that allows you to interact with them. You don't operate the machine directly 
A **Robot** is a machine that is able to make forms of limited descisions. It can take in information from teh environment and send out an output to make itself do something. More advanced robots have more sensors, more options of actions.
People tend to think of robots as human forms, but most of them don't look anything like that
**Computers** have inputs and outputs
So now we're connecting computers eg the interent. You've made a **Meta Computer** 

Algorobotic systems
eg Uber, algorithmic system with inputs, datacenter and at the end an actual person in a car
