> make work that represents the type of work you want to together

started making more illustration work
(prison education thing)
4 hour spot illustrations for the guardian
used to go around and find out who the art directors at the newspapers are, get their email and send them work

> be engaged and get involved
important to go out and try things eg make products, worst case scenarion you're gonna meet some good people
you never know where things are gonna go etc

## Peepshow
startde as a small colletive
2013 got a workshop at pick me up
working with people can alllow you to do bigger scale stuff

> figure out what you want and the steps needed to het there. This involves reseatch and asking wuestions poliyely

write a decent email

did a unpaid trip drawiing sort of thing, turned into a nobrow book when he got back
kept working with them after

> try try again

pitches don't always work out

Classic Mtt leading question. Should illustrators do animation or should they absolutely do animation?
Either make animation work, or at least have an understanding of how your work might move
Look at different types of animation, see what suits your work. Also good to show oter people's work for pitches so you don't have to make a whole animation for nothing. 


[Hpw we got to now](http://www.peepshow.org.uk/work#/how-we-got-to-now/)
BBC wanted a draw on a whiteboard thing
thought about doing cllages insetad
motion test, how would it work together with footage of a presenter (all this work happens before the first meeting). Got an emmy for it
Again if you want to do stuff like 3d pipes in space, composite footage of a notebook etc just get someone else in to do it 

> do things well and everything might leas to something else
People who work with you on one job will move around to different jobs, they might give you work there

[Map of hell](http://www.peepshow.org.uk/work/#/map-of-hell/)
Director who did the BBC show referred a national gegrpahic job on dante's hell (w/ danny trejo for some reason)
Filmed dancers in a greenscreen studio, collaged that together with stock footage
Even when you're established you will still sit and watch tutorials at night

> keep learning
stay relevant and all that
doesn't have to mean just new technology, eg he's doing textile stuff
Got a chance to do a japan trip to show the textile stuff
