[Processing](https://processing.org/)
[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)

Processing is Java, with some nice-ness added for drawing images: You get methods for drawing operations, a variable type colour, mouse position etc. Also fairly easy to get the two working together

Webcam things:

- Slitscan
- Time Displacement

- [Open Processing](https://www.openprocessing.org/)
- [Processing Camberwell](http://processingcamberwell.wikispaces.com/)
- [Hello Processing](hello.processing.org)

[PureData](https://puredata.info/) is some kind of visual programming language (ie. you move things around rather than writing code)
