TODO background

teaches at lcc

Octavo is a self published journal 
started in 1985, interested in modernist syuff
started an office called 8vo, to make work all about type
werent interested in big ideas, pbogography, illustration, Gill (Bob and Eric), Neville Brodys the face

earyl work for the sepentine gallery
hfg offenbach poster
boymans can beunigen totterda  graphic identity

8vo had the advantage og being on top of the yellow pages

octavo hournal ran from jan 86 to 7 90

the idea was to only ever publish 8 issues
each one woulf be the same format
all set in the same typeface (unica)
300gsm cover witha trace wrap around it
obv octavo format
16 pages
just red, black and greys
published every 6 months


They were all about things you could do with printing processes

For the second issue, a spot blue replaces the red plus special blacks, greys and varnish

Article on the guy who first specified helvetica in london in 58

Hans Rudolph lutz
letterpress halftone blow ups

3rd issue is printed lanscape
columnbia garphic design lecture series posters
villie something

Used spot colours to recreate the original posters

The colour scheme for each issue came out of the content

Issue 4
Wolfgang Weingart
How can one make swiss typography
lectures he gave in america that hand't been published before
Weingart used his own 6x6 weird slide projector, they got access to the original slides for illustration
again huge production value, special grays blacks varnish etc

Graphic design used yo be more like architecture, you dhad to talk to printers, typesetters all the time
Unlike now where its just you and your computer

5th issue aka the lowercase issue
lowercase use as a way of anti authoritarianism in germany, holland in the 20s
kinross
wim crouwel: lowercase in the futv lowlands

Design comes from 20s modernism
This might be the point where the design becam emore important than the content

design magazine critique of issue 6
This was the first issue to embrace stuff that could only be done digitally
Every spread was 24 columns

issue 7
Trying to represent iconic early graphic desing work in a new context
They had access to original material, dropped them into a more realistic envirnment to show that the people making the stuff weren't thinking they were the best designer ever making history

The most reproduced spread ever
an artucel about why graohihc designers font readm so they made it super hard to read

Octavo subsciption cards
posters for some of the issues

all of that early work was made from full scal paste-ups

All that typography (issue 7) was done by specifying it using math and numbers crop marks and such to a typesetter

authors manuscript came typed from the authoore
that would be marked up, sent to the typesetter, who would return the galley print

then youd cut  that up and paste onto  a grid
send this all back and forth via bikemessenger to the typesetter

ocatvo 8 1992
theyd run out of money
the cd was the new big thing
microsoft encarta was going around
fulll of californa type design, isonc etc
They were interested in what multimedia could mean for design
collectors had all these 7 issue waiting for the 8th, and they got this cd
256 colours, built in macromedia director
ytpography as interface
reading on screen was bad then, so they got voiceover bbc people to read out most of the content
6ue type was a way of navigating the audo content

it was bilt for mac 7.2, 18 months later when mac 9 came out it stopped working

octavo redux
is a book that they did 2 years ago that recods at full scale the original issues, the type soecifications, all the design artifacts
published with unit ediyions
produved via kickstarter
comes out feb 1

Again insane printing production value
a swedish printer that can reporoduce the rgb spectrum using something called hybrid inks, you can math about 90& of the pantone range
stochastic something instead of halftones so you dont see any printing dots
lots of work went into reporiducing the ournal as accurately as possible
