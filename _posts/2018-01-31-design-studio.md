Set up 9 years ago, now at 60 staff in London, San Francisco and Sydney doing huge branding and digitial design projects.

- Premier League rebranding
- Airbnb logo
- Deliveroo branding
- treatwell branding
- logitech rebranding

## Design-led thinking
Brands are now in a two way conversation with the cosumer blah blah blah

- Things like Siri, Google voice literally talking to you
- Airbnb branding where people are "invited to make their own mark"
- Ghost in the Shell ads that talk to you 

## Depop Rebrand

An online clithing and other stuff selling place (like an etsy type thing)

They make mood films to show what they learn from research. Came up with _We the unfollowers_ to base the work on.

Branding is ultimately about handing something off to another team to work with, in this case that was really succesful.

## Beat Rebrand

A Taxi app in athens, mainly in south america.
Looked at public transportation: It used to be these city-specific modes of transport (yellow cabs, red buses)

These people wanted to be the "good guys" in the industry

The key idea here is *open cities*
These branding exploration films are all fonund footage. 

Looked at symbols that cities use to communicate with people. Created an icon set for Beat
Started out using the icons along copy, then replacing some of the words with icons, getting more specific. Combining icons with photography, illustration.
Gamification: collect miles by riding around



## Premier League Rebrand
One of the most-watched leagues in the world, started out like this

The reason they needed a rebrand is they were droping Barclays. They had loads different logo variations, inconsistent lockups, people confused the Barclays logo with the premier league logo. All looked very bank-y. The broadcast graphics also weren't working too well. 

They also had a PR problem, people were unhappy with the money that's being spent on players, high ticket prices etc. 

- Site visits
- identity aufit
- stakeholder interviews
- all agency immersion (have people work on site for a white)
- fan panel
- sporting audit (look at other sporting leagues)

> We talk about pitches built, not the lives changed on them

Again, they did a design proposition: *we all make it*

Eyetracking analysis of the logo: People are looking at the type, the logo, but mostly the lion's face. Reduced the old mark into a simplified, more graphic verion. Allows things like reversing the logo. Positioned the brand along tech, entertainment, sports brands. 

Did broadcast graphics derived from elements of the logo, Image treatments (single colour print), lockups, colourways, variations of the proposition ("Antonio makes it")

Turns out the reason all these brands are having typefaces designed is to save on typeface subscription fees
