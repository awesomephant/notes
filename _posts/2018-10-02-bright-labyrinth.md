## Welcome to the Labyrinth
Started at CSM, there's also a book.
Hidden & unseen forces that shape communication practice today. Things that are happening now started 40 years ago, so we'll be looking at history.

Microsoft 1994: Where do you want to go today?
These were the first computers designed to connect to modems

It sums up a world we have gotten used to - mobile computing & connectivity.

'Now you can get four clicks into the organization'

Ovid cataloged every mth that describes a transformation - "Metamorphisis"

'Minos resolved to remove his shame, the moniotair, from his house, and hide it aaway in a labyrinth with blind passageways. Deadalus, celebrated for his skill in architecture, laid our tthe design and confused the clues ro direction and led the eye into a tortuous maze, by the windings of alternating paths'

Deadalous is the first engineer/designer recorde in western history

NIetzsche: If we dared and willed an architecture...

Jorge Lusi Borges
I know of a greek labyrinth that is a single straight line..

Hillary Clinton people taking a backwards selfie

THis isn't to say that technology is bad, but let's investigate when it changes ou behaviour: Suddenly these people arent facing clinton anymore - the labyrinth emerging.

## The bright labyrinth == the digital regime
We talk about digital aesthetics, and culture but that isn't enough. We have to look at the networked computer as something that creates new legalities, ways of identifcation etc.

## Visual communication today
Real time processing - we're used to stuff happening in real time. Back in the day things took time to process - where do you want to go today - whererever it is, I want to go now.

## SOud vision and movement
as different formats become more integrated, we start dealing more in basic categories in sound, vision, and movement
Instagram isn't really a set format, theres text, video, sound, things that disappear etc

## Interdisciplinary thinkning
Why don't we use communication as a platform to generate interdisciplinary thinking
Caroline Edwards

## Process as a new form of performance
If we'e no longer dealig with shape (what should typesetting be, what should illustration be), maybe we can get rid of the idea of the fixed outcome book, print etc() as well. Maybe the process can be an outcome in itself.

## Modern design is modern thought
IN the 20th century, music was a leader of thought. Now it's design and communication. 

Time based interaction, performance is what we're dealing with now.

Marshall McLuhann
> Without an anti environment, all environments are invisible. The role fo the artist is to create an anti environment as a means of perception and adjustment

For McLuhan, an environment is an invisible set of influences

How do we create an anti evironment

[The blue marble photograph]
You look at the photograph as this document of earth being beautiful and fragile, but there's also a hurricane going on. It's the biggest selfie we ever took

[Weird influencer staged what it's like when she gets up in the morning]
LIsterne product placement, the pancakes are taco shells, there's no tea in the cup
People were screengrabbing this instantly, ie. real time

Kids in front of nightguard
No-one in the nightgaurd is looking at each other - what's the difference between that and the kids? Nothing, just different tech.

## Questions
Let's talk about social media
Wired: Zuckerberg
we're realizing that social media isn't just a platform
all those fun personality tests were to target ads and political messages
culture war
Social media has become the trenches in an ongoing culture war
But now there's some debate as to the role of networks etc.

Tim berners lee: [Solid]() came out this week

What I found interesting about the anouncement was te framing as an alternative to the internet. 
Theres 2 schools of thought in media studies
1. we can take control of any medium, any medium can be democratic
2. (Which comes from mcLuhan) No, the medium dictates what's going to happen socially. TV is going to do what it does *because it's TV*.

Tim berners lee is clearly subscribed to teh second here

A point on cinema: It was immediately industralized, went into copyright law etc. THis is why it's sill when the right complains about the liberal hollywood, they're huge companies trying to make money in a cynical way.

Why is viscom at the surface (as opposed to music), si it because of distribution methods?
IN the 20th cenutry, the distribution of music was much more centralised. A beatles record was a global, singular event. Beyonce can sell platinum albums, but they don't have the same impact. (Although that might be different for different cultures)

### How do we (as viscom) learn from the mistakes music made in the 20th century?

CSM did a project on the fact that 70% of art school is female, but the number drops once you go into industry. Graphic design might look neutral to us (but it isn't). Is there a female graphic design? If you made a poster attacking the partiarchy, does that format support the partiarchy.

Social media platforms are a textbook example of what McLuhan talks about, in that they offer you a service. "On Facebook, we're not the customer, but the product". It starts as a (free) service and as such becomes part of the environment. 

Alternative use of capital
Financial capital vs Social capital

## You mentioned how a lot of things are considered free, especially our content (some folks like influencers are being paid but most of us aren't)

Do you think there's going to be a shift in the future?

I've struggled with this for a long time in the music industry. I think what happens is displacement. In music, most people don't make muc money from releases and streaming, but make money from live gigs. This used to be the exact opposite.
