Appearance and imagination: technology and metaphors of being
How does technology relate to the way we imagine ourselves, our relationship to the world?

[Rene Descartes: Diagram of the brain and its nerves]

Perception and the present
IN Decartes, there's a fundamental notion of mind-body dualism. What's the relation between mind and soul (the sould/sprit and the body). HOw does this play in the age of AI, robotics etc. WE look to the hostory of pholiosophy and art to answer the question.

Nam Hune Park: Information Super Highway (1995)
50 states of the US as video screens with different themes.

McLuhan: Understanding MEdia
> Our electric extensions of ourselves simply bypass space and time and create probem of human involvement and organisation for which there is no precenent

This extends in the age of social media, AI and visions of the future.

Rosen@ The limits of analysis
> The soul, spirit or intellect is not a mathematical relation.. The context of analysis is a drea, not an analytical discourse.

When thinkng about computuation in the brain, can you talk about it in the same context as conputers 
The hard problem: If you built a physical replica of the brain, would it be conscious?
How do we use emprirical sciences to talk about ourselves?

## Being and Nothing
Plato: Sophist

> When we were asked what we should apply the name *that which is not to*

This dialogue is about talking about *nothing*.

These ideas are at the root of postmodern thinking abut simulation, simulacra

The relation between original and appearance is key to understanding art knowledge and culture. The preence ot absence of the original defines the idea of humanity and technical knowledge

Hegel: Science of Logic:
> Being, pure being, without any further determination. In its indeterminate immediacy it is equal only to itself...

Original vs Copy (Benjamin)

Plato cave allegory
This is relevant now with fake news etc (eh), but also earlier with the emergence of cinema.

Bill Viola (2000): *Memoria*
A face that seems to just about exist.

**Poetical / Mathematical**
This is a distinction that allows us to work between technology (empirical sciences) and philosophy

Rose:
> [the poetical and the mathematica] seem to be two discontinuous levels of human spiritual activity...

Gerhard Richter (1982): *Kerze*
Photorealistic paintings of blurred photographs

**Mythical / Technical**
Our idea of being technical beings has a connection to the mythical.
Disnchatment of Nature in the 19th century - positivism. IN secularising the world (away from a spiritual understanding) how does that relate to our inner nature?

The presence of myth
> technological coer and mythical core... mythological and the rationalized orders f culture... culture thrives both 

Agnes MArtin (1965): Morning
Pencil on paper grid drawings. These symbolis the inherent beauty of nature, as it exists in tension with this rational, ordered space. 

McLuhan
> This extension of himself by mirror numbed his perceptions until he became the servomechanism of his own extended or repeated image.. adaped to the extension of himself.. [he] hdad beocme a closed system

*The gadget lover* in UNderstanding Media

Mary Shelley (1831): *Frankenstein* (original title)
Shelley very much part of romanticism. Following Kant (i the late 1700s) these thinkers were concerned with our relationship to nature.

Prometheus made humans from clay, but also gave them fire

The Future Starts Here (2018)

The future is now (2019 at the tate modern)

## Metaphors of Being
In the history of science, tecnology has an isometric relationship with the mind. We've imagined the brain to be like a telegraph, a typewriter, a computer.

The relations fo technology and perception are episodes of being. the concernn of present...

[The concept of mind] criticises the idea of "the ghost in the machine".

McLuan: COunterblast (1969)
> The age ofco-presence of all indivisuals is te age of communicaion - the age of instant humans. Computer sata-banks dissolve the human image.

Andreas Gursky (2016): *Media Markt*
Jaques Tati (1967): *Playtime*
Tativille, film archtecture book
Tati had this vast set built outside paris (Corbusier-type tower blocks)

A series of sketches looking at various absurdities of modern life.

Turkle: *Alone toether: why we expect more from technology and less from each other*
This and Tati speak to the same kind of idea - how does technlogy/modernism impact our experience?

McLuhan
> To behold, use or percieve any extension of ourselves in technological from is necessarily to embrace it

William Blake (1795): *Newton*

Blake (Jerusalem)
> If erspective rgans vary, objects of perception seem to vary; is the perspective organs close, their objects seem to close also

We've entered a Camera-Civilisation
Kircher: CAmera Obscura (1646)

The camera obscura changes our relationship to our environment. Rather than imitating the world, you're able to reproduce it. Suddenly we've entered a different era of looking. 

Da Vinci (1500) perspetive diagrams

*The harp and the camera* (1977)

> An historical event may be a symbol of the historical process of which it is part. [The camera obscura is] instrumental invention in actually bringing..

THe aro as a poetic relation to the world, while the camera disconnects us.

Friedberg: The virtual window

The rediscovery of meaning (1961)
> we shoudl read as well as observe and describe natura... [instead of] merely copying

*Man with a movie camera* (1929)
In the category of City Symphony. A dynamic expression of urban life. 
In many ways a film about film, the constructino of the film image itself. We see the editing room in which the film is being made. 

*Creative Evolution* (1911)
> Instead f attahing ourselves to the inner becoming of things, we place ourselves outside them in order to recompose...

Xeno's paradoxes on the notions o movement and rest. Arrow in flight.
In creative evolution, this is connected to cinema. 

Manovich: *The language of new media* (2001)
notes of instargamism

> Man with a movia camera is perhaps the ost important example of a database imagination in modern media art

[Cameron: *Terminator 2* (1991)]

The developmetn of cgi introduces into cinema a different conceptoin of being. No longer are images related to something out in the real world, but CGI can create any kind of illusion it wants to. He tals about the liquid terminator:

> a cybrg who can take on human appearance. His true form is that of a futurostic alloy.. While his true body perfectly reflects its surrounding reality, the very natur of these reflections shows us the future of human and machine sight.

(the language of new media)

Ray Kurzweil: *The singularity is near: when humans transcend biology*
He imagines a point in 2050 when we reach a singularity, when human and machine intellogence are able to coalesce into one thing.

[Eternime]
Collect you thought, stories and memories to reate an avatar that will live forever. *Become virtually immortal*

Poetic Dictino (1951):
> Only by magination therefore can the world be known. And what is needed is, not only that larger and larger telescopes and more an more sensitive calipers should be onstructed, but that the human mind should become increasingly aware of its own creative activity

## Being and NAture


Nihilism (1969)
> ... age of anxiety, where optimisim is defined as the belied that man is a machine, and where the spirit exists only in the dread of nothingness..

*re-Wired/Re-Mixed: Event for dismembered body*(2015)

The artists sees a live video from one place, audio from somehere else and his arm is being remotely controlled by visitors.

> The artists becomes optically an accoustically de-synchronized and performs partly involuntarily. It is as if the body has been electronically dismembered, spatially distributed and possessed with...

Richard Long: *A line made by walking* (1967)
A document of an interaction with nature. A photograph is able to fix the ephemeral product of a performance

Smiconductor: earthworks 

Vasulka: Mynd (2000)

All of these people are thinking in different ways about the convergence between technology and nature.

## Being and the frame

The camera, the screen and the frame have become the dominannt ways we see the world. The idea of the frame goes back to Plato's cave.

Sugomoto: Cinema Dome (1993)
Entire film in one image

Malevich says: cinema only lasts for 100 years from 1895 to 1995, then all cinema becomes animations

Arrival of a trian

Maxin Gorky (1896)
> Last night I was in the kingdom of shadows. Id you only kne how strange it is there. It is a world without sound, without colour...

Micrograph of tabular grain emulsion, kodak
Materiality of celluloid film. The image is fundamentally held on these tiny particles. IN the photograph we see all these gaos between the particles.

William Henry: *The oriel window at lacock abbey* (1835)

*The virtual wid=ndow* (2006)
> Once the term "virtual" is free fro its enforced association with the "digital", it can more accuraely operate as a marker of an ontological, not a media-specific, property.. Virtual images have a materiality and a reality of a different kind, a second-order materialit, liminally material

Sky Best: *Alwyn Park House* (2011)

Paul Sharits: *Frozen Film Frame Series* (1971-1976)
All frames from a film suspended in a case
This is also the time tat odak starts to build the irst digital cameras.

David Hall: 1001 TV Sets (End Piece) (1972-2012)
Also: TV interruptions. 1-2 minute films that were broadcast unannnounced into the normal TV programming. Tap film is wuite famous.
End piece was made to coincide with the turning off of the analogue TV signal. All of these were tuned into analogue TV stations, then went blank.

Richar McGuire: Here (2014)
Speaks to the presence and absence of the frame, and what exists inside it.

The presence and absence, the myth of the presence is the pixel.
