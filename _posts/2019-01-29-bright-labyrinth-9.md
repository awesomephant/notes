teacher: "Ken Hollings"
unit: 'CHS'
abstract: "Charcot’s studies in the ‘hysterical body’, Nijinsky’s Rite of Springand Artaud’s Theatre of Cruelty are evidence of the stresses undergone by the human body since the start of the modernist era. Meanwhile in the 21stcentury, the cyborg, wearable technological and digital implants represent the latest wave in the progressive transformation of the human body. What is the role of communication practice in an age when a ‘network of organs’ is in the process of becoming a reality?"
