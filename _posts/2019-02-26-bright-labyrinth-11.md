teacher: "Ken Hollings"
unit: 'CHS'
abstract: "Japanese monster movies are one example offered by Susan Sontag of what she called ‘the imagination of disaster’. Re-examined in the age of digital SFX and videogame design, what does that imagination reveal to us today? What are the politics of simulation – and how real is ‘real’? Does a digital ecology of networked crowds, landscapes and weather systems exist within the spectacular regime of the green screen? And are we in danger of crashing it completely?"
