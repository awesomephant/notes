1. Tell the truth
2. Act on the truth

Precautionary principle: People want to wait for certainty before acting on the problem (of course once you're absolutely certain, the thing has already happened)

```
A Scientist's opinion   A paper     A review of papers      The IPCC

```

Whenever we check present observations against past predictions, the pessimists seem to be the closest.

- *What Lies Beneath: The Understatement of existential Climate Risk* (2018)
- *Hot House Earth* (2018)
- *Deep Adaptation* (2018)

Climate change is worse than cause and effect: It has all of these feedback loops that make it worse exponentially.

Shifting the Overton window is useful (Hence *Extinction* rather than *Climate Change*).
