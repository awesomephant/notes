A definition of illustration:
> Any miage that participates in a comples text presented as a communicating artefact (for example, a communicating artefact could be a website, a text message, a book or a t-shirt)

[See also earlier lecture]

Most of the literature is aimed at undergrads - how you get into the industry etc. This doesn't address many images (photographs, folk art) that function as illustration.

This is based on a paper presented at bangalore: THe Nomadic Illustrator

[Uncreative Writing]

Kenneth Goldsmith's critique of contemporary poetry (it can't deal with online distribution, issues of ownership etc) also applies to illustration. Photography theory is useful to talk about illustration because photographs often function as illustration.

Barthes: *The Photographic Message*
An image's meaning is constructed by the context in which you encounter it

> THe press photograph is a message. Considered overall this message is formed by a source of emission, a channel f transmission and a point of reception ... whatever the origin an destination of the message, the photograph is not simply a product or a channel but also an object endowed with structural autonomy

When we talk about illustration, we take it out of the context it was intended for. The idea of autonomous images: Images that contain within them the context required to understand them, take that context with them when they move around online.

## Two ways how images move around online:

### Images online are framed

Desktop windows, the screen - everyting we look at is framed by the screen. We look at them in a space that feels personal. When we drag an image onto the desktop, it becomes personal.

Barthes: *Mythologies* talks about myths as a way of speech. Our laptop operating systems, facebook, browsers are modes of speech that are designed to be invisible. The online space leads to a certain kind of image-making: There are no circular browser windows (or illustrator windows). The way we interact with the world informs how we behave as creative practitioners.

We also don't think about the material that the screen is made from (liquid crystals), we look straight through it at the content. Similar: When we talk about photograohs, we talk about what they show, not what they are ("This is my mum", rather than "This is a scanned photograph of my mum")

[Facebook design principles]

Talks about transparency. Sans-serif fonts, light colours are someone's idea of what transparency is supposed to look at.
Judith Butler:
> The demand of lucidity forget the ruse that motor the 'clear' view ... What travels under the sign of clarity and what would

Of course there are tons of things that Facebook's "transparency" obscures: Algorithms, monetization.

[I defense of the poor image] talks about how 'low-fi' images have a Walter Benjamin aura of authenticity. Contrast between real people's images and advertising on instagram. We associate low-quality images with conversations with people we trust.

## Images that Move

Barthes:
> Whatever the otigin and destination of the message, the photograph...

[Shoebox britain: how shrinking homes illustration]

Even in the context of a static editorial illustration, the illustration moves: THe image appears on the guardian website, facebook, Twitter, Print, App. The context (and therefore the meaning of the image) changes each time.

Mitchell: The reconfigured eye:
> If Barthes is writing about images having 'determinate meaning' only when presented in the framework of a specific text, then the replaceent of traditionally rigif and stable printed text

[why fake a photograph]: Photographs have a truth-claim because they're indexical - directly linked to a place and a time by chemistry. Mitchell is worried about what happens to that truth-claim when digital images remove the direct link.

## 2: The ongoing moment

Geoff Dyer: The ongoing moment thinks about the history in a non-linear way. 
> As soon as I realised I was drawn o hats, the idea of the hat became an organising principle or node

Every photographer always comes back to the same blind accordeon player

[THe gay girl in damascus] was supposedly a blog about the Arab spring, but it was actually written by a middle-aged man in Edinburgh. The profile image was scraped from some random woman's Facebook. When she was supposedly arrested, actiists made illustrated versions of the image. Later the illustration was used to free someone else.

E-Flux editorial: Online identities are constructs made from words and images that resemble identities. However these things can have real influence in the real world.

This counts as a poor image

Sharks in a flooded mall
This image turns up every time there is a flooding somehwere (or even if there isn't a flooding). A movement of this shark image from national geographic to everywhere else.

[Networked fiction diagram]

This diagram shows a useful way of thinking about how images move and connect

Ciccorico:
> NOdes are authored as nodes, which is to say that they are self-contained semantic entities, eaningful both in isolation and in relation to the network of which they are a part

This phenomenon doesn't belong to the internet, but the internet speeds it up and makes it possible to trace images ina way that would have been very difficult before.

[William egglestone]
accidental novel (and some other novels)
Primal scream country girl

People talk about use of stock images on book covers as negative, but these images also function as nodes linkning the stories together

Another moving image:
[Tristram Shandy] black square (various editions)
The black square by refucisng to sho anything is still illustrating something

The black square is a pause in the narrative - we're asked to contemplate the death of a character
This comes from a 18th century funeral tradition

characters in [people of paper] are aware of the narrator
Malevich black square (the end of paining)
SCott McCloud: Reinventing comics
Figure a: two black squares
Figure b: a field at night 10 minutes apart

now there's a phenomenon of people having black square avatars on social media. 

[strange universalism]:
> The black square is everywhere. It's any TV or phone screen that's switched off. What's shown on screens is numbers posing as people. The switched off screen becomes a documentary image of real-existing technology...

Something that's opaque talks more eloquently about the world (more than transparent twitter and facebook)
