Bio
Studied at LCP (LCC) in the early 90s
Now teaches there on BA Graphics
Muir/McNeil

A body of typographic work aobut the way the roman alphabet relates to language. The nature of creativity as a curse, ore interested in an analytical, systematic way of working.

(insert book)

No longer at LCC! Part-time at UCA

# Machine Tools
A sort of design that doesn't work with clients, but instead with products that might be sold or used for clients. Machine tools are a cool category of engineering: things taht are used to make other things

## Creativity (Fuck Creativity)
(orginator of lateral thinking)
definition of the creative act
> bringin into being something that was not there before
this is arguably a dubious concept: more likely everything is a already there, we're just transforming it. creativitiy has a way of conferring power/success/intelligence on people -- creative people seen as on top of the pile
at the heart of creativity is self expression: the independent genius individual
this is something that's deeply busried in our culture

shots of awe (jason silva 2015)

most people probs buy into this kinda shit

kanye 2009 i am gods vessel, but my greates oa in life ...

all oof these are medaval notions -- some idea that were separate from nature 
a notion driven by individualism
adam curtis says: self-expression may well be the conformity of our time 
the ancient greeks had much more pragmantic views on this stuff: they had no words for an act of creation (except for poetry) --- plat says that a painter only imitates
in this ancient worldview the ablty to copy is a virtue, fabrication is held up, very little emphasis on original stuff

steve jobs (1995) the lost interview
says that ideas are only the start of something he doesn't deny that ideas have a purpose(, but he priviliges the process of analysing, building, making

### system and process
generative, systems design
 daniel dennett: darwins dangerous idea (1995)
the order of nature is design = order x time
thats what you see in growth systems, mechanical systems, conways game of life (1970)

buddha machine (2004)
all the thing does is arpreggio between 7 different notes -- when you have multiple of them , they generate harmonies

is this music, is it intentional, doe sthe lack of himan skill/intervention alienating when you listen oto it

### generative art
phillip gallanter (the theorist of generativity)
he says that generative art is any art practice where the artists creates a systsem .....

generative -- conditional - parametric =-- systematic == interactive === evolutionary == emergent 

generative design is in some ways similar to cooking -- you define rules (like recipes) n let the prcess run

they are 

- simple
- neurtal (tgere is variation)
- reporducible -- these things can be done again and agian and they#re the same and different

these are also the principles fromevolutio (above)

order x time
- programme
- algorithm
- process

disorder x time
- chance
- error
- collaboration

### order and disorder
sol lewitt geometric structures
e says working with a an is a way of aoiding subjectivity, it is also a way not having to design each piece of work
often he would just send a plan for a work to a gallery

biran eno / peter schmidt
oblique strategies (1975)
was a set of cards designed for bands -- each player would draw a card and would play according to whatever random instruction hey got -- using chance in a beneficial way

emma thomas
perfect machine (2002)
principal at practice for everyday life

overprinted arrays of parallel lines -- she's trying to perfectly overprint the red over the blue - but because of the conditions in the room prooerties of ink etc this c an never be achieved so you get images

conditional design
conditional design workbook
a whole book of instructions
each player has a different colour pen
example: draw a perfect circle -- you can't do it but product is quite beautifyl (also collaboration comes into the picture here)

in a way, the most perfect order is mathematics -- it's a closed system

## Terms of Reference
georges perec leads the notion of working with systems
in defence of a the void (1969):
there are two ways of getting water........

in oter words, building a system (laying pipes) is as good as doing things by hand (carrying buckets)

it's a novel without any e's -- a story, a narrative, but it constantly reminds us of its own materiality: language is stuff

william burroughs/brian guysin: cut ups

emmet williams
four directional song of doubt for five voices (1957)

le corbusier
chandigarh (1951)
contemporary architecture uses generative systems all over the place, but you see the beginnings of it in the modulor
he says the modulor is like a piano: it's tuned but you have to be able to play it well

stravinskky: rite of spring
bach (maybe well tempered clavier)

stravisnky say: the more constraints one imposes ..…the abrirariness …precision of execution

karl gerstner paintings
carro (1978)
v similar to albers
all about the mathematics of colour 00 difference and similarity of colour

alan mccollumn
the shapes project (2006)
a combinatory system that allows for billions of different shapes

mark boyle
tidal series (1969)
he asked people to shoot a map wof the world 
his kids now go around to those places,  take an 8ft by 8ft casting of the world
it's arbitrary but also real

susan derges
ibbous moon cloud (2009)
put photographic paper on the bottom of riverbeds -- beatifyl work entirey based on rocess

john averill
lottery cityscapes  

john maeda 
floar (1997)

daniel rozin (2007)
mirror

8vo
flux posters (1998)
had to design these posters without information -- s made a system to highlight different semantic information with different colours

generative design creates consistency eithout repetition

lorenzo geiger

sheley jackson
eh melancholy of anatomy

you would go on a website, pay and get a word that you had to tattoo on your body -- all of them put together would make a novel

### type
athe visual history of type (2010)

rev edward catich
the origin of the serif (1968)
kinesthisis: letterforms come from teh way the human bobdy works (serif in roman captials from a flick f the wrist with a broad bursh)

weingart says
four typefces are enoug to address every proble#

(all of this is about type as form, but the more interesting part is)

## type as language
we think of writing as secondary to speech (because the greeks), but really writing exists on a whole differet order

here's some prhects that use typography on langugae

king seijong
han'gul (1466)
perfectly rational writing system -- each shape relates to a position of your mouth when you make that sound

paul ellima (1989)
bits / found fount 1989
a set of objects that fit very specific rules
- man made
- fits in his mouth
- an object but also an image of an object

### Type as system
romain du roi (1692)
people startng to see type as a pure system separate from the human body -- made by a comittee that was tasked to catalogue everything, started with the typeace

firmin didot (1784)
plaque decoupee universelle (1870)
bayer alphabet (1925)
a m cassandre (bfur)
fregio meccano -- nebiolo

the 20th centruy is full of these modular type designs, they died because printers didn't want to use e,
