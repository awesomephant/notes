Illustration and deception

Roskill: Truth and Falsehood in visual images:
> An image cannot be tru or false in the sense that the propositions of science or mathematics are true or false

Yet we do think about images in terms of truth and falsehood.

Shaun Tan:
> Drawing a good picture is like tellling a really good lie - the key is in the incedental detail

The way you create an authentic-loloking image (deception) us paying close attention to detail and making it look incedental.

## Truth
[bristol a-z]
Maybe the most reliable image is a map. First, maps are published and copyrighted documents (giving them a sense of authority). We expect a degree of accuracy depending on the ( kind and scale of map).

THe categories defended:
What would it be like to have a 1:1 scale map? This would be a map that's so detailed it would need to contain an image of itself. We now get this sometimes in google maps

Also: On exactitude in science

SO: a true image might have a relationship to reality (but not in every detail). Maps are models of reality.

Semiotics three kinds of images:
1. Index: fingerprint 
2. Icon
3. Symbol: Written language (in order to mean something it doesn't have to look like the things it's representing)

Chimpansee fingerprint
For this image to exist, the chimpanzee has to be present. It's made by the thing it's representing. (if you re-drew it, it would become an icon). Fingerprint as an evidentiary image. We also conflate the fingerprint with identity - if you're fingerprint is there, you were there. 

Dauguerre 1838 photograph
Photographs are a difficult case. It's an icon, but also evidentiary. It's indexical because of the action of light on a silver plate. An indexical record of how light was bouncing of things. Without a caption, we couldn't be sure this was actually showing the boulevard de temple. The indexical relationship is really the only reliable truthfulness images have. 

Why fake a photograph
> The only place the photographs truth claim comes from...

As mentioned last week "the it's phenomena": We don't look at he material reality of photographs, but look through them at what they're showing. Photographs were being manipulated basiclly from the moement they were invented.

Sontag: On photography
Would we prefer a shit photograph of shakespeare to a great painting? Yes every time. There's this idea that a photograph can bring you into a place ina  way that no other image can.

[The first ever digital image]
Walden Kirsch by Russel Kirsch (1957)

In the case of a digital photograph, light is causing a numerical response. Reading it is essentially like reading a thermometer. It's not inherently less indexical than a film camera.

[First image from mariner 4]
This image comes from the thing as integeres. The scientists wouldn't wait until the image was rendered, so they assigned each number a crayon colour and drew out the image.

[Bomb cab at first 1/100000000th second Harold edgerton]
We have this assumption that a photo represents a moment in time (we don't really question how long that moment is). The above image is from a specially built camera of an atom bomb explosion (1/1m second shutter speed). It's an action tha's much faster than the eye could ever see.

[Atomic test explosion edgerton weird peach]

These images cause visual desperation - you hold onto eh trees and scaffolding to ground yourself. THese are images we cannot verify using our own experienc.e

[the hubble deep field]
This is a 100 hour exposure. In a dark patch of sky, you suddenly see these thousands of galaxies.

[Changbom park and juhan kim deep field image]
These deep field images are entirely impossible for humans to look at - they had to write software to make sense of them.

[Six stories from the end of representation]

Different modes of contrast in a microscope
In microscopy you have to increase the contrast to see what's oing on - none of these images are really true

When the first people were looking through microscopes, they saw alll kinds of stuff that wasn't there because they ahd no reference points in their reality.

Albrecht von Haller: Uterus and Vagina
This is too detailed to be useful. All these patterns of tissue that we can't realte to - the image stop soffering us  truth.

Stereoscopic photographs of a pelvis
cunningham

In order to be truthful, things need to be left out. Often in medical illustration, we essentiall draw maps (geometry) of anatomy. Bodyworlds is more like a 1:1 map.

[Agatha christie map] at the beginning of a whodunnit

Next: Court illustration
These are one of the few instances were drawings become evidential

Julia Quenzler
> They were using photographs before I came on the scene twenty years ago and drawings proveed to be far more revealing

The only thing she could be talking about ehere is subjective (from being there as a witness)

[kuglars people]
Reportage illustrators often talk about their images in opposition to photography (because they exist in the same space). THere's a myth of reportage illustratui - it looks line and wash because they're drawn fast, but conversely we start to think images that look like this mean someone was actually there. (naturalised myth).

Jill Gibbon on her website adds a fake sketchboo behind her drawings to give authenticity to the images. It does some of the work of describing the process.

> The effectiveness of blackmail photographs depend entirely on the victimes concession that they are undeniable. (blackmail drawings however, are easily deniable and would not work)

Gobrich: Art and Illusion

Loui FUller dancing (toulouse lautrec)
This doesn;t show the body or records the dance, but it shows some kind of bgger, subjective truth.


[bonny prince charlie / prince henry]
captions dictate the way we read images - the iamge hasn't changes, but our reading of it has. When historians disagree about images, our idea of truth becomes shaky

## Lies

[Reverse side of a painting 1670]
Tromp d@ouil painting

Gobrich art and ilusion:
> It's important to be wuite clear eherein the illusion consists. It consists, I believe

These aren't a respected genre of paintin - thet;re more like a magic trick

Ames chair demonstrations in perception

From one angle the deception look real, from any other angle they reak down.

Sontag:
> As wittgenstein argued for wrod that the meaning is in the use - so for each photograph

[Roger fentonL TH valley of the shadow of death]
Sontags accusation is that fenton moved the cannon balls, nyt reporter tries to prove her wrong (and doesn't prove anything). THe only thing these images tell us is that fenton was thre and took these photos. When we forget about fenton, the truth in these images are even more dimnished.

Beyus on a forced landing
> Had it not been for the tartars I would not be alive today ... Yet it was they who discovered...

[Remains of Beuys]
[Joseph b after a forced landing]

These two images appear in two different monographs that both tell the above story (which is a lie)

Ian fleming and another writer: Operation mince meat
Britain and the allies tried to convince germany that were going to invade sycile
They gave a dead london person all kinds of documents - letters, naval identity card, a suitcase containing made up plans to invade ardinia and dumped it (using a sub) on the coast of spain.

Also the context in which we find images change the way we read them.

[Hurricane sandy day after tomorrow]
[Installation by superflex]

The tweet captions direct our understanding of these images

[death in the air 1933]
These were created using props by a bbc employee

Atlas group bu waleed raad
He made up this group of artissts working in the lebanese civil war (all ofwhom were him)
These use of a deception to talk about something that wasn't being talked about

JJ Abrams: S (2013)
A novel with two characters commenting on it. All these tip ins.

This creates a naturalised narrative situation (suddenly we have a credible reason for these images to exists) in literature these are diaries

Leanna Shapton: Important artifacts
A love story in the form of an auction catalogue

Visual coventions used by deceptions:

- Black and white photography (somehow we think its more authentic because it's associated with documentary photos) Also: Nat Tate
- Concatenation: If iages are presented in the same context, we assume they are connected
- Nat tate images with fingerprints using the index confirmin nat taes existence

Lye close in bristol doesn't exist - they're a copyright trap to catch people copying the map
Google maps also has these
